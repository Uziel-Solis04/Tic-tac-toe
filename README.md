# Tic-tac-toe
A Tic-tac-toe game on a protoboard using a 8051 microchip. In this project we use a matrix keyboard module to send the signal to the 8051, letting it know which LED it is going to put on. Using assembling language we make the logic and manage the signals depending on the player's turn.
